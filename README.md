Trabajo 
The Python language was devised in the late 80s by Guido Van Rossum, on a 
Christmas in 1989, Guido Van Rossum, who worked at the CWI (Dutch Research 
Center), decided to start the project as a hobby giving continuity to ABC, a 
programming language that was developed at the CWI.
This project did not transcend since at that time the hardware made it difficult to use. 
The name Python arises because Guido Van Rossun liked a humorous group called 
Morty Python. In February 1991 the code for version 0.9.0 was published for the first 
time in alt. sources. This version had classes with inheritance, exception handling, 
functions, and modular types. Guido described that in this version appeared a 
module system adopted from Modulo-3, a structural and modular programming 
language.
In 1994 comp.lang.python, the main python discussion forum, was formed, marking 
a milestone in the growth of the python user group. for this same year, python 
decides to release version 1.0, this version of python includes functional 
programming tools such as lambda, reduce, filter and map. 1995 was released 
version 1.2 of Python in CWI, this was the last version released by CWI, Van Rossum 
continued working at the Corporation For National Research (CNRI), in Virginia. 
where Van Rossum would release various language versions. Van Rossum was 
inspired by Modular-3 for version 1.4 and also built-in support for complex numbers. 
In the year 2000 an important change occurs, the main team of python developers 
moved to BeOpen.com, to be able to form the BenOpen Python Labs team. 
However, the CNRI corporation requested that version 1.6 be published at the time 
in that the team left the corporation. This version includes a substantially higher 
license than the versions published on CWI. For Python 2.0, list generation is 
included, one of the most important features of the haskell functional programming 
language. After Python 2.0 was published by BeOpen.com, Guido Van Rossum and 
other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations to continue developing the 
different versions. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation was created, which as 
of Python 2.1 owns all the code, documents and language specifications. In 2008 
we have the latest Python update, version 3.0 with the PEP3000, which is designed 
to rectify errors in the design of the language.
